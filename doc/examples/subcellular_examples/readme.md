### Dendrites and spines
In this folder, you will find the ipython notebook and the corresponding files to give you a touch-base working example for using SamuROI on dendrites and spines. The ‘exampledendritetimeseries.tif’ file is the image sequence to be analyzed. 
For generating the `.swc` file in neutube, we first generated a maximum intensity projection of the time series in Fiji. In order to be read by neutube, we generated a ‘mock’ stack by duplicating the image and merging the two identical images into the `exampledendritesmockStack.tif` file. This file can be imported into neutube to generate the `exampledendrite.swc` file. When SamuROI imports the swc, it will automatically be flattened.
